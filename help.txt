How to play

Here is the set up

    Take all 5 Gold chips and 4 / 5 / 7 of each of the Gem 
		Chips for 2 / 3 / 4 player game
    Shuffle each of the 3 Mine decks and turn 4 of each face up. 
		As they are purchased or reserved, replenish the face up cards.
    Shuffle the Nobles and turn up the number of players + 1 nobles.
    Determine who goes first

Each player takes one of the following options on each of their turns

    Collect Gem Chips – Either:Take 1 Gem from each of 3 different 
		stacks (not gold)
    Take 2 Gems from one stack, as long as there are 4 or more chips 
		in that stack
    Reserve a Mine for playing later. You can take either a face up 
		mine or the top card of any deck. When you take this option, 
		you also collect a Gold Chip if available.  You may not 
		reserve a Mine if you already have 3 Mines reserved.Nobles
    Build a mine from the face up Mines or a reserved Mine.
    At the end of a player’s turn, if that player has the number of 
		mines required for a visit from a Noble, that player takes 
		one of those nobles.

How to Win

Splendor may be a simple game rules wise, however there is a lot 
	of depth to the interplay available. The game will start 
	slowly, as players take chips and reserve mines. As the mines 
	start getting built, the game can start progressing at a rapid 
	fire pace.

1x4 Mine

Evaluating the board and determining when to take chips and when to 
	reserve a mine is one of the difficulties new players have with 
	the game. Reserving a mine can feel like you are wasting a turn. 
	But on mines like the one to the left it can be the right call. 
	Taking the mine and the gold (which is a wild) can guarantee you 
	can build a mine on your 3rd turn. If you were to take gems on 
	each of your first two turns, you could still build this mine on 
	your 3rd turn, however you are leaving it up to your opponents to 
	not buy or reserve this mine in front of you.

 

Mines

Another pit fall is when to start working for the Tier 2 and 3 mines.

Tier 1 mines have an average gem cost of 3-5.
Tier 2 mines have an average gem cost of 5-7.
Tier 3 mines have an average gem cost of 7-14.

The increase in cost tends to keep newer players from going after 
	these mines until they have no option left. While mines of all 
	3 ranks only give a reduction of a single gem, the Rank 2 and 3 
	mines have a sizable amount of victory points. Picking up a 
	couple rank 2 mines can get a player close to ending the game 
	early.

“The Machine”

A machine is built one piece at a time. The same is true of the 
	strategy known as “The Machine.” The goal here is to get as 
	many mines as you can, preferably working toward picking up 
	the Nobles as quickly as possible. To get The Machine underway, 
	you would want to start buying mines quickly. Every turn you 
	can build a mine, do it. Each one will reduce the cost of your 
	future mines and making it easy to get more. You won’t be building
	deep in this strategy, but instead building wide, looking for 
	2-3 of each type of mine as early as possible and then start 
	working towards the Rank 2 and 3 mines while picking up free 
	mines from Rank 1 when available.

“The Drought”

While not, in itself, a way to win the game, playing to dry up one 
	type of mine is a good way to delay the game and get to the 
	late stages. What you are looking to do here is to build or 
	reserve every mine of a particular gem type that you can in the 
	Rank 1 mines. If you can get them all, or keep their availability 
	low to the other players, you can capitalize big time. To do this
	 most effectively, you should pick a gem type that is decently 
	represented among the nobles and the Rank 2 and 3 mines. You will
	 be advancing your late game and delaying everyone else significantly.
